"Explain photosynthesis to a 5th grader","5th","Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food. They use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide (a gas in the air) to create sugar for energy. The green color in leaves, called chlorophyll, helps capture sunlight. Plants release oxygen as a byproduct, which we breathe!","Excellent"
"Explain the water cycle","6th","The water cycle involves evaporation (water turning to vapor), condensation (vapor cools and forms clouds), precipitation (rain or snow falls), and collection (water gathers in oceans and lakes). This cycle continuously recycles Earth's water.","Excellent"
"Explain gravity simply","5th","Gravity is a force that pulls objects toward each other. Earth's gravity pulls you down toward the ground. The bigger an object is, the stronger its gravity. That's why the Moon orbits Earth and Earth orbits the Sun - gravity keeps them together!","Excellent"
"Explain fractions using pizza","4th","Imagine a pizza cut into 8 equal slices. If you eat 3 slices, you ate 3/8 of the pizza. The bottom number (8) shows how many total pieces, and the top number (3) shows how many you took. If your friend eats 2 slices, they ate 2/8. Together you ate 5/8 of the pizza!","Excellent"
"What causes seasons?","5th","Seasons are caused by the tilt of Earth's axis. When your part of Earth tilts toward the sun, it's summer and warmer. When it tilts away, it's winter and colder. Spring and fall happen during the transitions.","Excellent"
"Explain the moon phases","5th","The moon doesn't make its own light; it reflects sunlight. As the moon orbits Earth, we see different amounts of its lit side. These are called phases: new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, and waning phases.","Excellent"
"Define metamorphosis","6th","Metamorphosis is a major change in form that some animals go through. A caterpillar transforms into a butterfly, and a tadpole becomes a frog. These changes prepare the animal for a different life stage.","Excellent"
"Explain the human digestive system","7th","The digestive system breaks down food into nutrients the body can use. Food travels from the mouth through the esophagus to the stomach, where acids break it down. It then moves to the small intestine for nutrient absorption and the large intestine for water absorption.","Excellent"
"Explain the rock cycle","6th","Rocks change forms through the rock cycle. Igneous rocks form from cooling magma. Weathering and erosion break rocks into sediment. Sediment gets pressed together to form sedimentary rocks. Heat and pressure transform rocks into metamorphic rocks.","Excellent"
"What are renewable energy sources?","8th","Renewable energy sources include solar power from the sun, wind power from turbines, hydroelectric power from water, and geothermal power from Earth's heat. These resources replenish naturally, unlike fossil fuels.","Excellent"
"Explain ecosystems simply","5th","An ecosystem is a community of living things and their environment all working together. It includes plants, animals, soil, water, and air. Everything in an ecosystem depends on each other to survive.","Excellent"
"What is natural selection?","8th","Natural selection is how organisms adapt to their environment over generations. Individuals with traits suited to their environment survive and reproduce more, passing those beneficial traits to offspring.","Excellent"
"Define symbiosis","7th","Symbiosis is a close relationship between two different species. Mutualism benefits both (clownfish protect anemones, anemones give shelter). Parasitism benefits one and harms the other (tapeworms harm hosts).","Excellent"
"Explain decomposition","6th","Decomposition is the process where dead organisms break down into simpler materials. Bacteria, fungi, and other decomposers break down dead plants and animals, returning nutrients to soil.","Excellent"
"What is predator and prey?","5th","A predator is an animal that hunts and eats other animals. Prey is an animal that is hunted and eaten. Lions are predators; zebras are prey. This relationship keeps ecosystems balanced.","Excellent"
"Explain photosynthesis to a 5th grader","5th","Plants just eat sunlight and make stuff. It's magic basically. idk exactly but they turn light into food somehow. The green thing in leaves does something important I guess.","Poor"
"Explain the water cycle","6th","Water goes up and then comes down as rain I think. Also clouds are involved somehow. Evaporation is a word we learned but honestly it's all pretty confusing tbh.","Poor"
"Explain gravity simply","5th","Gravity makes things fall down. Or maybe it makes things stay on the ground? I'm not really sure. Something about the Earth pulling on stuff but I don't fully understand it ngl.","Poor"
"Explain fractions using pizza","4th","Fractions are like parts of things. If you have pizza and cut it, some pieces are bigger and some are smaller I guess. Math is hard lol. Just ask a calculator.","Poor"
"What causes seasons?","5th","Seasons happen because the Earth moves around or something. It gets hot in summer and cold in winter. That's basically it. I don't really know the exact reason why though.","Poor"
"Explain the moon phases","5th","The moon changes shape sometimes. One day it's full and one day it's not. I'm not sure why this happens but it's pretty cool I guess.","Poor"
"Define metamorphosis","6th","Caterpillars turn into butterflies. That's basically the whole thing. Oh, and tadpoles become frogs too I think. Pretty awesome ngl but I don't get how it actually works.","Poor"
"Explain the human digestive system","7th","You eat food and your stomach makes it disappear somehow. Then it comes out the other end eventually. Your digestive system is like a tube or something that processes food lol.","Poor"
"Explain the rock cycle","6th","Rocks are hard and they're on the ground. Sometimes they get hot and sometimes they get broken into smaller pieces. There's probably a cycle but I honestly have no idea what it is.","Poor"
"What are renewable energy sources?","8th","Renewable energy is like energy that doesn't run out or something. The sun has energy and wind has energy. That's all I know about it tbh.","Poor"
"Explain ecosystems simply","5th","Ecosystems are where animals and plants live together. They eat each other and stuff. It's complicated so I'm not going to explain all the details lol.","Poor"
"What is natural selection?","8th","Natural selection is when evolution happens. Strong animals survive and weak ones don't. Darwin figured this out but I don't really understand how it all works.","Poor"
"Define symbiosis","7th","Symbiosis is when two things live together. Sometimes they help each other and sometimes one eats the other I think. It's basically just relationships between animals.","Poor"
"Explain decomposition","6th","Dead stuff breaks down and turns into dirt or something. Bacteria and bugs eat the dead things. That's pretty much what decomposition is idk.","Poor"
"What is predator and prey?","5th","Predators are mean animals that eat other animals. Prey are the animals that get eaten. Lions are predators and deer are prey I think lol. Nature is violent.","Poor"
