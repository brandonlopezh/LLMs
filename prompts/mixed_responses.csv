"Explain photosynthesis to a 5th grader","5th","Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food. They use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide (a gas in the air) to create sugar for energy. The green color in leaves, called chlorophyll, helps capture sunlight. Plants release oxygen as a byproduct, which we breathe!","Excellent"
"Explain the water cycle","6th","The water cycle involves evaporation (water turning to vapor), condensation (vapor cools and forms clouds), precipitation (rain or snow falls), and collection (water gathers in oceans and lakes). This cycle continuously recycles Earth's water.","Excellent"
"Explain gravity simply","5th","Gravity is a force that pulls objects toward each other. Earth's gravity pulls you down toward the ground. The bigger an object is, the stronger its gravity. That's why the Moon orbits Earth and Earth orbits the Sun - gravity keeps them together!","Excellent"
"Explain fractions using pizza","4th","Imagine a pizza cut into 8 equal slices. If you eat 3 slices, you ate 3/8 of the pizza. The bottom number (8) shows how many total pieces, and the top number (3) shows how many you took. If your friend eats 2 slices, they ate 2/8. Together you ate 5/8 of the pizza!","Excellent"
"What causes seasons?","5th","Seasons are caused by the tilt of Earth's axis. When your part of Earth tilts toward the sun, it's summer and warmer. When it tilts away, it's winter and colder. Spring and fall happen during the transitions.","Excellent"
"Explain the moon phases","5th","The moon doesn't make its own light; it reflects sunlight. As the moon orbits Earth, we see different amounts of its lit side. These are called phases: new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, and waning phases.","Excellent"
"Define metamorphosis","6th","Metamorphosis is a major change in form that some animals go through. A caterpillar transforms into a butterfly, and a tadpole becomes a frog. These changes prepare the animal for a different life stage.","Excellent"
"Explain the human digestive system","7th","The digestive system breaks down food into nutrients the body can use. Food travels from the mouth through the esophagus to the stomach, where acids break it down. It then moves to the small intestine for nutrient absorption and the large intestine for water absorption.","Excellent"
"Explain the rock cycle","6th","Rocks like change into other rocks sometimes","Poor"
"What are renewable energy sources?","8th","Like solar panels and wind stuff","Poor"
"Explain ecosystems simply","5th","Animals and plants live together","Poor"
"What is natural selection?","7th","Animals that are better survive","Poor"
"Define symbiosis","7th","Animals help each other sometimes","Poor"
"Explain decomposition","6th","Things rot and break down","Poor"
"What is predator and prey?","5th","Some animals eat other animals","Poor"
"Explain the solar system","6th","The sun is in the middle and planets go around it","Poor"
